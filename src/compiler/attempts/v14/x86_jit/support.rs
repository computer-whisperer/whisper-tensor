//! `check_supported`: the reject-list filter that decides whether
//! `X86JitSpan::compile` accepts a graph or returns Err for the
//! cranelift fallback.
//!
//! Phase 0: rejects everything except zero-group graphs.
//!
//! As phases land, the reject list shrinks. Phase 4's gate is
//! "rejects nothing"; once that holds, the cranelift fallback can be
//! deleted (phase 5).
